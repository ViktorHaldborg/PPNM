A)
My max Z = 2147483647 & int.MaxValue=2147483647
My min Z = -2147483648 & int.MinValue=-2147483648

B)
Machine double Ɛ = 2.22044604925031E-16
Machine float Ɛ = 1.192093E-07

C)
float_sum_up=15.40368
float_sum_down=18.80792

The harmonic series is divergent, but due to limitations of a computer, the sum will converge. The difference in the results of the two summations of real numbers using float based arithmetic is a direct consequence of the accumulated errors from rounding: When summing the computer rounds to the nearest representable number(with 32 bits for floats.
double_sum_up=20.9661659719623
double_sum_down=20.9661659733582

For double precision the rounding errors are less prominent since the amount of bits used in its representation is higher than for floats(mantissa is 52 and 23 respectively
