The decay of activity follows an exponential form y(t)=ae^(λt).
Rewritten gives the form which shall be fitted: ln(y)=ln(a)+λt.
Coefficients a and λ is obtained through least square fitting using QR decomposition

Half life of ThX determined to be 4.04451793348687 days with an uncertainty of ±0.0851954141152858 days.

The half life of 224Ra is 3.6319(23) days, which is not within the estimated uncertainty of the half life of ThX.

The errors on the fitting coefficients is found to be c_0=0.0298375229832802 and c_1=0.00353553390593277
