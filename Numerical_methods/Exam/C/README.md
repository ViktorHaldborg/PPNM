Part C of the examination project.

Higher than 1 multiplicities are now allowed. 
The code manages to find roots with up to and including multiplicity 3.
The code seems to be stable for lower dimensions n less than 10, but i seem to get an error every 30'th diagonalization of a matrix (n=9).
The resolution in points fixes this, but compromises speed significantly.
