In the a), b) and c) a function, its derivative and antiderivative is interpolated based on tabulated points. However in the given case the tabulated function is in fact analytically given, therefore for the purpose of explicitely showing the accuracy of the interpolation some of the splined points are plotted against the graph of the analytical function (the function from which the tabulated points are generated).
